# Today's plan:
1. Create an ansible server & 2 nodes
2. Establishing connection

# Setting up servers
- We create the server ec2 instance 
- download package using wget & then install ansible server'spackage
- epel = extra paxkages for enterprise linux 
- To create shahee paneer/a dish we bought the ingredients by installing the main ingredient/paneer/ansible
- we need to install other dependencies/components to create a dish - these dishes are part of the package
- How will ansible server know what nodes are connected with it - what nodes it has to send updates to
- In ansible server, find ivnentory file/host default file, enter pvt ip of nodes for saving it to let server know who it is connected with "vi /etc/ansible/hosts"
- Inside the file, create a "demo group" and paste node1 & 2 pvt ip
- another file in ansible: config file where commands are written but //ed, remove // before inventory & inventory file activated! also remove // before sudo-user = root
- connection still not established b/w nodes & ansible server - we create 3 ansible users in the nodes as root user won't be known for each node practically
- "adduser user/ansible" in 3 servers, setting passwords using "passwd user/ansible"
- switching users in servers with switch user with su - ansible
- giving root privelege to ansible by editing visudo file, add:
ansible ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
- STILL have to write commands w/ sudo since you are not root user - ansible user is only a sudo user not root user
- NO communication b/w servers through ssh, come bacck to ansible server and we need to install ssh 
- make changes to /etc/ssh/sshd_config & node 1 and node 2 should be allowed to connect
- create the connection in the server by creating 
- sudo apt-get install ansible
got erro "sudo ansible --version
ERROR: Ansible requires the locale encoding to be UTF-8; Detected ISO8859-1." after installing
solved by https://www.reddit.com/r/ansible/comments/z66t0l/comment/jwenrji/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3 adding following to .bashrc:
```
export LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8
export LANG=en_US.UTF-8
export LANGUAGE=en_US.UTF-8
```

- work as an ansible user and create necessary 
- ansible --version shows "config file = /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg" 
- the hosts file will not work until we make chanes to ansible.cfg

- nano /etc/ansible/hosts
created a group including my vm called "demoByYash" using:
[demoByYash]
192.168.122.128

- vi /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg and uncommented "$ ansible-config init --disabled > ansible.cfg"

- there are only 2 files in /etc/ansible. my ansible.cfg says:
```
# Since Ansible 2.12 (core):
# To generate an example config file (a "disabled" one with all default settings, commented out):
#               $ ansible-config init --disabled > ansible.cfg
#
# Also you can now have a more complete file by including existing plugins:
# ansible-config init --disabled -t all > ansible.cfg

# For previous versions of Ansible you can check for examples in the 'stable' branches of each version
# Note that this file was always incomplete  and lagging changes to configuration settings

# for example, for 2.9: https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/stable-2.9/examples/ansible.cfg
```
so i ran ansible-config init --disabled -t all > ansible.cfg

- adduser ansible in both machines

- su - ansible for switching to the new user

- i got an error when trying to test install httpd "sudo apt install httpd
[sudo] password for ansible: 
ansible is not in the sudoers file.
This incident has been reported to the administrator."

- to create it same as root user, i logged out of ansible user on BOTH SERVERS and ran "visudo", under the "allow root to run any commands anywhere", I addded the following:
```
ansible ALL=(ALL)   NOPASSWD: ALL
```
- TO CHECK if connection has been established b/w node & server, come to server and run su - ansible and establish ssh between the 2 USERS

- when i ran ssh 192.168.122.128, i was able to connect with the node from my server

optional i think:
- changes made to /etc/ssh/sshd_config in both servers:
1. added this line: PermitRootLogin yes
2. uncommented PasswordAuthentication yes
3. outside of the file ran service sshd restart

- to verify the connection, turn ansible user first, establish ssh connection

- if i had another node, i'd have to connect to 2nd node from main server again - since i have to enter password again and again while trying to establish connection with ssh, I have to remove password authentication - not practical since we have to update 100s of server, automation with password is not feasible

- solution, we gen a key inside ansible server using ssh keygen, one pub and one pvt, it is imp to be signed in as same level user in all servers - when creating trust relation, you need gen ssh-keygen seen using ls -a

- inside .ssh i'd see id_rsa and id_rsa_pub and when you connect using ansible@ip again, you'll be asked to enter passwd first only -
